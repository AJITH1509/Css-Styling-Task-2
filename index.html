          <p>
            A full-stack developer is a developer or engineer who can build both
            the front end and the back end of a website. The front end (the
            parts of a website a user sees and interacts with) and the back end
            (the behind-the-scenes data storage and processing) require
            different skill sets.

            A front-end developer builds the front-end portion of websites and
            web applicationsâ€”the part users see and interact with. A front-end
            developer creates websites and applications using web languages such
            as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allow users to access and interact
            with the site or app

          <h2>Back end developer</h2>
          <p>
            Back-end developers are the experts who build and maintain the
            mechanisms that process data and perform actions on websites. Unlike
            front-end developers, who control everything you can see on a
            website, back-end developers are involved in data storage, security,
            and other server-side functions that you cannot see
